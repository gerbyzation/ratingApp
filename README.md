# Rating app

This is a simple app build for an phonegap/cordova assignment for our coding class at DAT. It's a simple rating app storing some information about the item you want to rate in a SQLite database (not very fond of WebSQL/SQLite :-/ ).

I didn't go with Phonegap with jQuery Mobile as the rest of the class did, but choose to work with the Ionic framework. The main reason is that I was looking for an excuse to learn some AngularJS. As a consequence of this choice I had to figure it out on my own and couldn't fall back on the instructions our lecturer provided. This resulted in me making a few silly mistakes with promises (or lack of) in factories :)

And yeah, sorry about the messy repo... I'll $q.deffered() that I'll do better next time :)
